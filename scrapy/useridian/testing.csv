review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,KANLen09,"Sep 23, 2018",10,"Move over, Grand Blue (despite the MAL score) and Hinamatsuri (Spring 2018's best comedy)!

Asobi Asobase is here to take your place not just as AOTS for Summer 2018's super weak BUT strong comedic presence, but also AOTY for the overall yearly comedy genre, and I have the full experience to tell you why this series is damn underrated, and hidden behind it is pure insane high school gag-comedy...AT ITS BEST AND FINEST!

If there was a rating above 10, I would give this series a multiplier 100/10, because this is more than just some mindless AF comedic masterpiece. It's comedic execution will creep you with its"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,Zaber_san,"Sep 23, 2018",9,"At first, I thought this anime will be your typical girl show with no comedic element whatsover. Why did I expected that? The opening. Openings are always the one that summarizes the plot or the composition of the story of an anime. And I was definetely wrong. I actually asked myself ""Am I watching this on YouTube right now?"" because I got clickbaited really hard.... and I love it. Comedy anime will always be there this season. It is a rule already on the anime industry that at least 1 comedy show will be a talk on the anime community. One of them this season"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,Karhu,"Jul 29, 2018",4,"Surrealistic slice of life comedy series centering around high school girls who act and play like children. When I heard what this series is about, I expected 2 pure 4 this world type of comedy that relies on the imagination of a child. What a blessing, I thought. I could have been more wrong, but not by much.

The actual surrealistic side of this anime is entirely limited to the facial expressions of our characters. These vary from goofy cartoon physics to coaxedintoasnafu-tier memes that are about exactly as accurate and fresh as the third season of Rick and Morty. Only thing missing are surprise dickbutts"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,SovietWeeb,"Jul 29, 2018",8,"I like to think of this show as PopTeam Epic but good. 

I honestly find this funny with very little in the way of complaints. 

I honestly adore Olivia's design. I like her personality and that character model. Even the voice actor fits so well. I also like that she isn't dumb like you see a lot with her characters. I'd love to see her more in other shows or even characters like her. For some reason, I kind of feel disappointed that she doesn't know any English or has ever been to America. I do want to see her mother and what she's like."
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,Stark700,"Sep 23, 2018",8,"If I told you Summer 2018 was lacking in comedy shows, then that statement itself would sound like a joke. There were several ones including an anime that dealt with gender bender idols, a show that made every journey to school look like a misadventure, and even one with a demon girl dealing violent dropkicks. It wasn’t easy to stand out as much when it comes to comedy. Yet somehow, some way, we have Asobi Asobase that came along like a God-sent gift.

Diving myself into this series felt like entering a world of absolute absurdity. Asobi Asobase is like a deconstruction of the ‘cute girls"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,FruityDream,"Nov 18, 2018",2,"One dimensional cardboard characters, plain bad looking art style and jokes that aren't funny in any way, there's the essence Asobi Asobase. The comedy is mostly build around either characters doing or saying something completely random and unexpected or character having a weird over the top facial expression. After seeing first 10 minutes I had already seen all this show had to offer. I still went and watched every episode trying to confirm there weren't any good jokes in the show, there were not. Confirming this wasted about 6 hours of my time though, so I guess joke's on me. 

A good situational comedy would"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,literaturenerd,"Mar 23, 2019",3,"Overview:

Hoo boy, this review might be a little controversial with some of my MAL friends. We all know how subjective comedy is and how we all find different things funny. I heard glowing reviews about this anime, but the jokes just really weren't working for me. 

Humor Style:

Do you have young kids in your family? Have you ever watched Teen Titans Go? Asobi Asobase uses a very similar approach to its humor and episodes, only in my opinion its slightly less funny. For example, characters will constantly make stupid faces and that's the joke. Characters will reference popular things, and that's the entire joke. There's"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,felixlovesanime,"Jul 24, 2019",10,"Asobi Asobase represents why anime comedy is pretty damn special: because it can reach limitless possibility without betraying the sense of normalcy.

What I'm trying to say is: Asobi Asobase is funny as hell.

First of all, do not be fooled by the cover art/poster of the series. In fact, the Shoujo-ness of the poster simply represents the irony that is about to unveil: a story about girls being girls in rawest ways imaginable. It is not to say that what we're dealing with is an Ecchi or blue comedy in vein of Seitokai Yakuindomo or Ao-chan Can't Study. In Asobi Asobase, everything that is wrong about"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,SamuelSanjaya,"Oct 18, 2018",10,"If there's an anime that can beat nichijou in terms of comedy, than it's asobi asobase.

The art was kinda a little bit offputing at first, but you'll get used to it at certain point.

The comedy is just brilliant. this is the first anime that i know of, to put a ""shittyflute star spangled banner"" as a BGM.

The character is so well done, and did i mention the voice acting ? some of them are still new to the industry but have such a great voice. Especially for Hanako Honda seiyuu.

Overall, it's a great anime, and kinda underrated. hoping for a season 2 soon"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,Omee190402,"Jul 31, 2018",9,"Really enjoying it at the moment, specially after all the BL stuff, Laser implant and the character developments till the recent episode (episode 4) are all going nicely.

It's genuinely a funny show and i can see it's rating going closer to 8 in the next couple of weeks.

I Highly recommend it For those who haven't watched it yet.

And I know there are many of you who are pointing out that there are a couple of more shows aired in the past similar to this.

But i would recommend everyone to ignore that and watch the show to it's merit."
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,MoodMojo,"Aug 23, 2018",10,"A comic work of art and best anime of the season, if not of the year, would be the least I can say to describe Asobi Asobase. The anime manages to show its strengths from the very beginning that I had already decided to give it a 10 after only the first episode which had me crying of laughter.

Each episode comprises of 4 parts during which we follow this squad of three middle schoolers and their adventures if so you wish to call it. Each girl has her own characteristic traits which are unique to her and the more you discover about the characters, the"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,filifjonkan,"Nov 26, 2019",8,"You know that feeling when you yearn for something that is just fun? Nothing else, no depth or wrinkled foreheads, thinking of the plot...well, this is the anime I longed for a while ago.
I had sooo many real good laughs from, I almost fell out of my sofa. These girls sure knows how to make you laugh, with their hilarious expressions and longing to be among the popular kids.

I will try to review this show in the order that MAL has put up, I want to warn you for mild spoilers ahead.

First; the story: story? What story? There is not a single clue to this"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,DawnHibiki,"Mar 1, 2021",10,"I expected this show to be a nice slice-of-life series because the opening provides three main girls with pretty dresses singing about friendship.  Then it quickly turns out to be a vicious comedy about the three main jealous schoolgirls who have brought some wacky, over-the-top sense of humor. Hilarious situations and rapid gags between the three main girls are what make this show so entertaining, and I am amazed by the direction and cleverness of the humor.  

The main cast consists of three girls, and they are Hanako, Kasumi, and Olivia. Hanako is obsessed with being popular, Kasumi dislikes most fun things, and"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,_lynxy_,"Jul 30, 2018",8,"Asobi Asobase is like nichijou but this made me laugh super hard, and this is why i love both of this anime so much.

I find that the main characters are funny as hell with the way their face reactions and how their tune changes drastically especially Hanako and Kasumi, this two girls made my day. Olivia on the other hand is a cute wannabe foreigner that i want her to be my waifu.

Nevertheless hats off to the voice actress on delivering a splendid work to mimic the character's personalities, i see most of them are quite new to industry, hopefully with them debuting to this"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,Thisizaraisu,"Jun 25, 2020",9,"Before I get to Asobi Asobase, I wanna touch on another series I'm acquainted with.

Nichijou is, in my opinion, one of the more overrated anime of all time. While the animation is phenomenal, I don't believe the writing and pacing are nearly good enough to back it up. While it is an enjoyable series, it is not the pinnacle of comedy as some people treat it to be. My experience with Nichijou made me believe that explicit randomness would be extremely difficult to pull off in anime.

Why do I bring up Nichijou, you may ask? Because Asobi Asobase completely killed the preconceived notions that Nichijou"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,lolzee9x,"Jan 24, 2019",10,"Daily lives of highschool girls AKA nichijou on crack 10/10

Story lacks depth but makes up for it by high-quality and consistent stupidity and slapstick

Low budget moebait art that I usually hate works so well here, since part of the enjoyment comes from being jebaited so hard

Hina Kino is a demon goddess. You could remove all music and I'd still rate sound 10/10 because Hina Kino on Hanako is good enough to be a standalone piece of art.

Great deconstruction of CGDCT into Questionably Cute Girls Doing Stupid Shit (QCGDSS)

Haven't enjoyed this level of mindless comedy since Saiki & Nichijou. The only thing that threw me off"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,ABPAEAE,"May 15, 2019",9,"First of all, I went into this anime without much prior reading. I reverse searched a smug anime girl reaction maymay and tracked it down to this show. The rating was solid and the description sounded like it could be decent. I was hesitant to continue watching after the first two episodes, but I'm glad I stuck with it. The description of Asobi Asobase really makes it sound like a slice of life show, and the first couple episodes mainly focused on introducing the characters would make most viewers believe it is in fact just another mediocre slice of life. However, once the foundation is"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,TsubasaFamily,"Jul 30, 2018",6,"~Very minor spoilers contained for episode 4~

What can I say? When I wrote the early review for this series, my thesis was ""this could be one of the funniest shows of the season or a complete disappointment."" It's with regret that I have to say it seems to be the latter.

The first episode is still incredibly funny, and I can't deny that. The novelty and surprise of the humor, the artwork, the offbeat pacing of the punchlines, and the sound/music were great for this type of over-the-top absurdist comedy, and fans of this type of humor (generally found more in Western animation) will surely agree.

Unfortunately,"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,mimimilk,"Mar 20, 2021",6,"[No spoilers review] Make sure to watch Asobi Asobase alone and if using earbuds, keep volume lowered.  This show is outrageous and hilarious!  Multiple times I found myself having to pause to recuperate myself after dying from the crazy obnoxious screaming and over the top facial expressions.  Asobi Asobase: Workshop of Fun is not your slife of life girl's doing cute things anime despite what cover picture and opening shows.  Anyone watching would realize quickly after the first episode, no just a few minutes into the first episode.

The animation is the weakest point for this show.  After multiple"
review,37171,Asobi Asobase,,,TTagain,"Sep 23, 2018",8,"‘’Not what it seems’’ is far from enough to describe how the poster above fools you. Asobi Asobase is the exact opposite of cute and friendly moe show. It is a loud, profane, vulgar and atrociously hilarious show.
It is about three girls with wildly different personalities coming together to form a new pastime club to…..pass time, playing games and stuff. As much as benign as that sounds, Asobi Asobase is full of toilet humor and inappropriate jokes, that will leave you wondering….in simple words ‘’WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?’’
You see in this show a man fires lasers out of his butt and there is a bug"
